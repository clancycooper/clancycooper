## About Me
My name is Clancy (he/him) and I am 29 years old and reside in Kernersville, NC. 

My interest in programming first started all the way back in the Myspace era, where I would find myself obsessively tweaking my profile page using HTML. Flashy icons, custom DIVs, hidden music players, I was fascinated with solving these little programming challenges. The very first PC I ever used was a blue and white Mac that my mom had for work use. She was a graphic designer specializing in typography who was gifted a PC in order to start experimenting with photo editing software. My relationship with technology has only grown since those days. 

However, I never considered myself smart enough to become a tech professional. I dropped out of high school, got my GED and enrolled in Cosmetology school at 18. My school was shut down for fraudulent activity and I was left hopping from one minimum wage job to the next. Things were feeling grim, to say the least. In 2019, I started my own business. I supplied fancy rats to breeders and hobbyists all along the East Coast. Yes, rats. As my business grew, so did the needs and expectations of my customers. I needed an adoption application, a way to store data about my animals and clients, a way to handle transactions, deliver high quality photos, share resources... I needed a website. I got to work on BoggleBros.com. Using Wordpress, Jotforms, and Canva, I designed my site to suit my business' growing demand. Something began to happen along the way, though. I was spending more time fiddling with my site and researching how to use all the plug-ins and tools than I was actually tending to my business. The desire to code was coming back with a vengeance. 

At this point, I started working through exercises on FreeCodeCamp.org, reuniting with HTML, learning CSS and scratching the surface of JavaScript. "Hey, I really like this... I think I want to go back to school." I wasn't sure how to make this happen, mostly because I was flat broke. I did some research and found out that Walmart offers free tuition to their employees, so I took an Overnight (10pm-7am) shift as a janitor and enrolled in SNHU for a BS in Computer Science. It was brutal juggling the 40+ hour work week and part-time studies, but I would scroll through internship opportunities before bed to keep the motivation flowing. I stumbled upon an ad for Catalyte, a program that takes aspiring developers and puts them through a bootcamp before offering them a low-paying job to get their foot in the door. It was extremely competitive, but it sounded like a dream. I filled out an application and began researching other train-to-hire programs that were like Catalyte. That was how I heard about Year Up. 

Year Up is a non-profit program that aims to bridge the opportunity divide for young adults trapped in the cycle of poverty. You enroll for 6 months of paid training, transition to 6 months of paid internship at a Fortune 500 company, then receive alumni support throughout your career. I cannot put into words the profound effect this program has had on the trajectory of my life. I am now in my third month, with only 2 months left before starting my internship. You can see my full academic journey on my GitHub profile in my PluralSight and Capstone folders. I'm looking forward to whatever lies ahead in my programming career, thanks to Year Up.
